# Computer component
* Computer nowadays base on concept of IAS - Von neumann machine
   * Data and instructions are stored in a single read-write memory
   * The contents of this memory are addressable by location, without regard to the type of data contained there
   * Execution occurs in a sequential fashion (unless explicitly modified) from one instruction to the next
* Hardwired program
   * The result of the process of connecting the various components
