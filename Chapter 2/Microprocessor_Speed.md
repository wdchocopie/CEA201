# Microprocessor Speed
* Pipelining: allowed to break down process to multiple instruction, allowed to work multiple instruction simultaneously
* Branch prediction: Attempt to guess condition statement \(if else\)
* Data flow analysis: Analyze how data move through program to creating optimized instruction.
* Speculative execution: Used branch prediction and data flow analysis. Predict what instruction will be needed next and starting to work before it's absolutely certain. Holding result in temporary memory, keep processor busy as possible
