# Performance Balance
By ajust the organization and architechture to compenstate \(bù lại\) for the mismatch among the capabilities of the various component

Achitechture example:
* Increase number of bits that are retrieved at once by making DRAM's wider
* Change DRAM interface to make it more efficient by including a cache or other buffering scheme
* Increase the interconnect bandwidth between processors and memory by using higher speed buses and hierarchy of buses to buffer and structure data flow
* Reduce the frequency of memory access by incorporating \(kết hợp\) increasingly complex and efficient cache structures between the processor and main memory
