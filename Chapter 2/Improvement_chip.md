# Improvements in Chip Organization and Architecture
* Increasing hardware speed of Processor
   * Shrink logic gate size
      * More gates, packed more tightly, increasing clock rate
      * Propagation\(lan truyền\) time for signal reduced
* Increased size and speed of cachesa
   * Dedicating part of processor chip
      * Cache access times drop
* Change processor organization and architecture
   * increase effective speed of instruction execution
   * Parallelism \(song hành\)
