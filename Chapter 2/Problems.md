# Problems with Clock Speed and Login Density
* Power
   * Power density increased
   * Dissipating heat
* RC \(Resistance and capacitance - Điện trở và điện dung\) delay
   * Speed at which electrons flow limited by resistance and capacitance of metal wires
   * Delay increase as RC product increases
   * Wire interconnects thinner, increasing resistance
   * Wire closer together, increasing capacitance
* Memory latency
   * Memory speeds lag \(slow down\) processor speeds
